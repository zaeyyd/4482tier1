#John Lemon But Like PacMan (Unity Game)

hi ðŸ‘‹

###this is the tutorial I followed
> https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner?uv=2020.3

### these are the changes I made

gave the player the ability to find a "power-up" which allows them to destroy/disable enemy ghosts (like in Pac-Man). Enemies are only destoryed when they look at the player (makes the player kinda like Medusa) 


some details: 

- player gets power-up when they walk infront of Gargoyle with green torch
- getting a power-up triggers the following for 5 seconds 
    - green lighting
    - pac-man power-up audio
    - the ability to destory enemies
